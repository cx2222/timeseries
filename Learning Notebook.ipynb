I know that some of what I am writing here is not entirely technically correct, but it is for the purposes of teaching people who are not comfortable with the lingo.  So if you find a \"mistake\" in notation, it is likely there on purpose to avoid unnecesary confusion -- but of course let me know if you think there is a substantive one. \n",

Anaconda includes python and Jupyter Notebook, so you are all ready to use Jupyter Notebook after you have downloaded Anaconda. Download anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. Choose the python 3.7 version that is correct for your computer (i.e. Windows, Mac, or Linux).\n",
